# Taustajärjestelmät

This is a repo for a Metropolia back end course. There is an assignments folder with different assignments that were required to complete the course. The folder also contains a back end project with the name Budget API. The project is a simple Web API that lets the user save their income and spending transactions to a MongoDB server. 

Here is a YouTube video explaining the project in Finnish: https://youtu.be/ZtDoS5B2p3c
